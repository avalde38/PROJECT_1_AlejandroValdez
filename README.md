<h1>Me and Rodrick just vibing all good</h1>
<p>Rodrick is so babygirl.<br>                                                                                                                                              
My biggest concern as a kid was wondering if i wanted to be Rodrick or be with him.<br>                                                                                                                                Fine, I'll do it myself.<br> 
Rodrick Rules is the best book and movie,<br>
all of his moments in the books is pure gold,<br>
he is the only normal one.<br>
God, I wish I was Rodrick.<br>
For example, Rodrick definitely likes the starving artist look and the grungy feel of rock
and how it was so abrasive when it first came out.<br>
Roderick and I have had a few good chats here and there and he has all good vibes to you all.<br>
Been a crazy up and down year and overall.<br>
Great Vibes all around!
