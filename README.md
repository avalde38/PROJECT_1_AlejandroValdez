<h1>Me and Rodrick just vibing all good</h1>
<p>Rodrick is so babygirl.</p>                                                                                                                                                 
<p>My biggest concern as a kid was wondering if i wanted to be rodrick or be with him.</p>                                                                                                                                                 
                                                           Fine, I'll do it myself. 
                                           Rodrick rules is the best book and movie,
                                      all of his moments in the books is pure gold,
                                                       he is the only normal one
                                                      God, I wish I was Rodrick. 
                        For example, Rodrick definitely likes the starving artist look and the grungy feel of rock and how it was so abrasive when it first came out.
                                      i've made for a character so i hope it's ok!! 
"Fine. I need the music by noon today though so I can start on it"
"Why don't you just come over so I can help you with, um, establishing a vibe?
Roderick and I have had a few good chats here and there and he has all good vibes to you all.
Been a crazy up and down year and overall.
Great Vibes all around! We have one more night here, 2 shows. Come hang out!</p>
