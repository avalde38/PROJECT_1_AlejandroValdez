<h1>Me and Rodrick just vibing all good</h1>
<p>Rodrick is so babygirl. <br>
My biggest concern as a kid was wondering if i wanted to be rodrick or be with him. <br>
Fine, I'll do it myself. <br>
Rodrick rules is the best book and movie, <br>
all of his moments in the books is pure gold, <br>
he is the only normal one <br>
God, I wish I was Rodrick. <br>
For example, Rodrick definitely likes the starving artist look and the grungy feel of rock and how it was so abrasive when it first came out. <br>
I've made for a character so i hope it's ok!! <br>
"Fine. I need the music by noon today though so I can start on it" <br>
"Why don't you just come over so I can help you with, um, establishing a vibe? <br>
Roderick and I have had a few good chats here and there and he has all good vibes to you all. <br>
Been a crazy up and down year and overall. <br>
Great Vibes all around! We have one more night here, 2 shows. Come hang out! <br>
